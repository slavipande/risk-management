# Welcome

## Description

Welcome to the **SAP BTP Application Development** example application and tutorial.

Use this example to learn how to develop an application based on SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and how to deploy it on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) step by step. It's planned to provide multiple lessons that are built upon each other. You can start the tutorial with the first lesson, or start in between, because the source code for every tutorial lesson is provided in this repository.

This first version of the tutorial, contains an example CAP application with an SAP Fiori elements and SAPUI5 Freestyle UI, and based on that a tutorial that shows how to deploy that application to Kyma runtime.

Watch out for new lessons.
